# GlobalGameJam 2019 - Squabblings, first price at Harz University

A funny coop game, where you fight against your siblings for the sweets scattered around the house, while mum and dad are out.
This is the result of a 48h game jam in 2019 at the Harz Universtiy, developed in a team of five people.
